      <text>Section 2(f) D.C. Law 20-89 would have added D.C. Law 17-152, § 11b, to read as follows:</text>
      <text>"Sec. 11b. Employer records.</text>
      <text>"(a) Employers shall retain records documenting hours worked by employees and paid leave taken by employees for a period of 3 years, and shall allow the Mayor and the Office of the District of Columbia Auditor access to the records, with appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this act.</text>
      <text>"(b) When an issue arises as to an employee's entitlement to paid leave under this act, if the employer does not maintain or retain adequate records documenting hours worked by the employee and paid leave taken by the employee, or does not allow the Mayor or the Office of the District of Columbia Auditor reasonable access to the records, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the employer has violated this act".</text>
      <text>Applicability of D.C. Law 20-89: Section 3 of D.C. Law 20-89 provided that the act shall apply upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register.</text>
