    <text>Upon application made by any individual holding public office, any candidate, any person who may be a potential registrant under this subchapter, or any political, exploratory, inaugural, transition, or legal defense committee, the Elections Board shall provide within a reasonable period of time an advisory opinion with respect to any specific transaction or activity inquired of, as to whether such transaction or activity would constitute a violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any provision of subchapter I of Chapter 10 of this title[§ 1-1001.01 et seq.]. over which the Elections Board has primary jurisdiction. The Elections Board shall publish a concise statement of each request for an advisory opinion, without identifying the person seeking the opinion, in the District of Columbia Register within 20 days of its receipt by the Elections Board. Comments upon the requested opinions shall be received by the Elections Board for a period of at least 15 days following publication in the District of Columbia Register. The Elections Board may waive the advance notice and public comment provisions, following a finding that the issuance of the advisory opinion constitutes an emergency necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, welfare, or morals.</text>

      <heading>Editor’s Notes</heading>
      <text>Section 2(g)(1) of D.C. Law 20-79 would have rewritten the first sentence in (a) to read as follows:</text>
      <text>"Upon application made by any individual holding public office, any candidate, any person required to submit filings to the Elections Board under this title, any person who reasonably anticipates being required to submit filings to the Elections Board under this title in connection with a pending election or any subsequent election, or any political committee, political action committee, or other person under the jurisdiction of the Elections Board, the Elections Board shall provide within a reasonable period of time an advisory opinion, with respect to any specific transaction or activity inquired of, as to whether such transaction or activity would constitute a violation of any provision of this title or of any provision of Title I of the Election Code over which the Elections Board has primary jurisdiction".</text>
      <text>Section 2(g)(2) of D.C. Law 20-79 would have added (c) to read as follows:</text>
      <text>"(c) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a transaction or activity undertaken by a person in reliance on an advisory opinion from the Elections Board is lawful if:</text>
      <text>"(1) The person requested the advisory opinion;</text>
      <text>"(2) The facts on which the opinion is based are full and accurate, to the best knowledge of the person; and</text>
      <text>"(3) The person, in good faith, substantially complies with any recommendations in the opinion".</text>
      <text>Applicability of D.C. Law 20-79: Section 3 of D.C. Law 20-79 provided that the act shall apply upon the latest of: (1) The inclusion of the fiscal effect of the act in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register; or (2) January 31, 2015.</text>
