      <heading>Uniform Statutory Source:</heading>
      <text>Sections 2-208 and 1-205(4).</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <heading>Changes:</heading>
      <text>Revised to reflect leasing practices and terminology, except that subsection (2) was further revised to make the subsection parallel the provisions of Section 1-205(4) by adding that course of dealing controls usage of trade.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <heading>Purposes:</heading>
      <text>The section should be read in conjunction with Section 2A-208. In particular, although a specific term may control over course of performance as a matter of lease construction under subsection (2), subsection (3) allows the same course of dealing to show a waiver or modification, if Section 2A-208 is satisfied.</text>
